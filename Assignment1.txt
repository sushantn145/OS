Q2.A) Create three directory a b and c and create a.txt,b.txt and c.txt
	in each directory respectively and then copy c directory into the a.
	-->	cat >dir1
		cat >dir2

		cp dir1 dir3

	B)Move Directory b to c.
	-->	mv dir2 dir3
		
	C)Create alias of ls -lh command to your name.

	D)Change Directory name a to cdac.
	-->	mv dir1 CDAC
		cat CDAC


Q3. A) Create five files file1.txt , file2.txt ,file3.txt file4.txt and
    	file5.txt with some text inside it. Search for 's' character
    	inside all the files using grep command.
    	Also Use cat to view all file content together.
	-->	cat >file1.txt
		cat >file2.txt
		cat >file3.txt
		cat >file4.txt
		cat >file5.txt
		OR
	 	cat >file1.txt;cat >file2.txt;cat >file3.txt;cat >file4.txt;cat >file5.txt
 	
		grep 's' file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt

	B)Create file.txt using cat and edit that using nano editor.
	-->	cat >file.txt
		nano file1.txt
	c)Create 5 empty files using touch command
	-->	touch f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt f4.txt f5.txt
	D)Remove previously created directory a , b and c.
	--> 	rm dir1
		rm dir2
		rm dir3
Q4. Create a file with some content using vi editor
	a) Display the file using cat command
	-->	cat file1.txt
	b) Display line numbers along with content
	-->	cat file1.txt -n
	c) Display the file in reverse order using tac
	--> 	ls -r
	d) Combine multiple files using cat command
	-->	cat f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt f4.txt > f5.txt

Q5. Create Random some files and sub directories.
	a) display files row wise, column wise, 1 per row
	-->	ls (column wise)
		ls -1 (row wise)
	b) sort the files in ascending, descending order
	-->	sort file1.txt 
		sort file1.txt -r
	c) Create some hidden files and sub directories and display them using “ls -a”
	--> 	sub-directory --> mkdir .a1
		hidden file -->	cat >.a2 
	d) Change time stamp of some files and directories using touch command and display the files using ls -t ls -rt
	-->	touch dir1 dir3
		ls -t	(It will shows letest file first)
		ls -rt	(It will shows old file first)
	e) Recursive display contents of your home directory.
	-->	ls -R
	f) display all attributes of files and directories using ls -l
	-->	 ls -l CDAC
	g) display attributes of a directory using ls -ld
	-->	ls -ld
==================================================================================
Q1. Create directory of your name and then create 4 files inside it named
	a.txt, b.txt, c.txt and d.sh. And change the directory permission to
	only user and also files permission to only user such that
		a)user can read and write the file a.txt and b.txt
		-->chmod =rw- a.txt b.txt
		b)user can write the file c.txt
		--> chmod +w+ c.txt  
		c)user can exectuable the file d.sh. Make
			Contents of file d.sh:
			#/bin/sh
			ls -lh
		-->	shell file
			#/bin/sh
			ls -lh
			?????????
Q2. Change the permission of the previous directory to executable only.
	Analyze the output.
-->	chmod +x c.txt
Q3. Change the permission of the previous directory to read only.
	Analyze the output.
-->	chmod +r c.txt
Q4. Use echo to list the all files of your home directory.
-->	echo *
Q5. Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory
-->	???
Q6. Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory with extension name .conf
-->	??
Q7. Use echo to append your name to a.txt
-->	 echo sushant >>a.txt
==================================================================================

Note:Many operation might not work.Analyze them
1.Create Three level nested directory a,b and c
--> 	mkdir a
	mkdir b
	mkdir c
a)Create at least one hidden file in each directory
-->	cat >.a.txt
	cat >.b.txt
	cat >.c.txt
b)Create at least one normal text file in each directory
-->	cat >A.txt
	cat >B.txt
	cat >C.txt
c)Copy c into a
-->	cp a c
	cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'a'
	Sol-:We have to do recurcively
	cp -R a c 
d)Copy file inside a into b
-->	 cp -R b a

2.	Change the third level directory c permission to read only
-->	chmod =r-- c 

3.	Try copying third level c directory to outside of a
-->	cp -R c a
	cp: cannot stat 'c/.c.txt': Permission denied
	cp: cannot stat 'c/a': Permission denied

4.	Create the directory  “data“ inside b
-->	cd b
	mkdir data

5.	Change the permission of b to read and write only
-->	chmod =rw- b 

6.	Create directory “data2”  inside b
-->	cd b
	-bash: cd: b: Permission denied
	
7.	Create data.txt file inside b
-->	cd b
	-bash: cd: b: Permission denied

8.	Rename the second level directory c to copied_dir
-->	
9.	Change permission of copied_dir to only executable
-->	
10.	Try ls on copied_dir
-->
11.	Try moving copied_dir to outside of a
-->	
12.	Try moving data directory outside of a
-->
13.	Now change the owner of the directory a to root
-->	
14.	Change permission of a to read write and executable to only user
-->	
15.	Try creating directory sample inside a
-->	
16.	Create directory x outside a
-->	
17.	Try moving x inside a
-->	
18.	Create directory movies
-->	
19.	Change group of movies to sudo
-->	
20.	Change group of movies to avahi
-->	
21.	Try changing permission after changing ownership to root
-->	
22.	Try Changing permission after changing group to sudo without sudo
-->	
23.	Try Changing owner and group both to root
-->	
24.	Try changinging permission
-->
